# pyMetronomeGUI

Simple metronome created for drumming practice. Combines metronome and a timer/stopwatch. Also has ability to schedule different speed beats for set times, to support gradually speeding up.


Two modes:
Basic - standard metronome but also includes a timer/stopwatch

Schedule - lets you set different BPM for periods, e.g. 1 minute at 100bpm, then 1 minute at 110bpm, then 1 minute at 120bpm, etc

Needs dearpygui and simpleaudio installed to run the .py file. 


The file pyMetronomeGUI is a package build with pyInstaller, you can run this provided you've got Python 3 installed. It needs both .wav files and the font file to be in the same directory.
