# pyMetronomeGUI

Simple metronome created for drumming practice. Combines metronome and a timer/stopwatch. 

Three modes:
Basic - standard metronome but also includes a timer/stopwatch

Schedule - lets you set different BPM for periods, e.g. 1 minute at 100bpm, then 1 minute at 110bpm, then 1 minute at 120bpm, etc

Automation - lets you increase BPM by a set amount every X number of bars, e.g. every 10 bars increase by 2BPM. 


Needs dearpygui and playaudio installed to run the .py file. 


The file pyMetronomeGUI is a package build with niutka. It needs both .wav files and the font file to be in the same directory.
